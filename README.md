# Floor-Mapping Project - Frontend

## About

This project entails a straightforward web application designed to enable users to upload images depicting the seating layout of their workplace. Users can iteratively upload seat configurations, subsequently obtaining a file detailing the total seat configuration.

## Why?
Amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, many companies transitioned to remote work arrangements for their staff. However, as the pandemic subsided, a shift towards hybrid work arrangements, combining remote and office-based work, has emerged. Recently, during an event at a company I was associated with, a pertinent issue arose regarding the need for a system to track seat bookings in advance. Unfortunately, the existing solution lacked this capability.

This circumstance served as the impetus for the development of this project. While it does not encompass the entire implementation of a booking system due to limitations such as the absence of access to Active Directory (AD) and other requisite components, the project focuses on enabling users to upload a floor plan and define seat configurations. This functionality serves as the foundation for displaying and managing seat layouts effectively.

## Really why?
This project provided me with a valuable opportunity to delve into Angular development, marking my initial foray into this framework. Through this experience, I acquired proficiency in several new tools, including:
- Angular Web Framework (Services, Components LifeCycle)
- AWS S3 (IAM, Bucket Policies, AWS SDK)

The main goal was to learn to use Angular. It is a popular framework that many companies adopt in their tech stack.

## Current state
currently working on dockerizing this build and then deploying it...
